			<div class="about__col">
				<p>I am currently working in the Web Design department for Adtrak, a large digital marketing agency based in Nottingham. My passion lies with coding and developing websites but I am heavily involved with projects from initial conception, right through the design stage, coding, testing and setting the site live. WordPress is the CMS that I use to create dynamic websites. I have expanded my PHP skills by building on these sites and coding in extra functionality for the clients to use in the backend of WordPress.</p>
				<p>I have used JavaScript and jQuery to bring interactivity to them, and it is a language that I am looking to explore a lot more. I have thoroughly enjoyed working with JavaScript; from creating custom maps with the Google Maps API, to combining it with WordPress ACF Fields to create tabs that the client can control from the backend of WordPress, and customising forms by populating inputs with information about certain pages that will be helpful for the client receiving the enquiry.</p>

			<div class="about__col">
				<p>Styling is done using SASS, and I am starting to look more into the BEM methodology to improve readability and usability of my code. I am also comfortable dealing with MySQL databases, using CPanel and WHM to manage the sites.</p>
				<p>In my personal time, I enjoy learning about new technology that I can use in projects. I am currently improving my skills with JavaScript by looking into frameworks such as react.js and node.js. I write a blog to document some of the things that I am using. This helps me to digest and remember the information, and also possibly share solutions to problems that I have overcome to others that may be experiencing similar problems.</p>

				<h2 class="website__header">Metsi Technologies</h2>
				<p>The client wanted full access to the CMS, so its usability was very important. I built in extra functionality so that the client could decide the width of the hero image for each page with the toggle of a switch. All images, logos and text were pulled in from WordPress, so the client could add and change what they wanted. </p>
				<p>Features like this were important  to them because they were supplying content, and wanted to add a lot after coding had finished. Hidden fields in the their vacancy application form were also built in to automatically tell the client which job the user was applying for without the user having to specify themselves.</p>

				<h2 class="website__header">Chattrbox Web Application</h2>
				<p>I built this web app with the help of a front-end development book. I used Node.js to build a WebSockets server to facilitate real-time communication. Npm scripts were used to streamline my workflow and it also gave me a chance to work more from the terminal. ES6 JavaScript was compiled into ES5 using Babel and Browserify so that it can be used on older browsers.</p>
				<p>This was a great project that allowed me to get a more in depth look into the workings of an application. I was able to use a modular approach and get to grips with features that I was more unfamiliar with like JavaScript classes, arrow functions and imports and exports.</p>
				<p>My next job for this project is to improve the design and experiment with some animations and effects for when new messaged appear on the screen.</p>

				<h2 class="website__header">Landscaper Tech Event</h2>
				<p>This was a single page site that was used to promote an event that Amtrak was sponsoring. I used a simple layout to convey as much information as possible about the event, whilst still being balanced and interesting to view.</p>
				<p>I was asked to incorporate Adtrak colours, as they were one of the main sponsors. Although it is quite a bright colour compared to the other sponsors, the result was nicely balanced.</p>
				<p>Please note: this is the demo site, as the actual site is no longer live.</p>

				<h2 class="website__header">Manor Mix Concrete</h2>
				<p>The content on this site is quite for down the page, which meant a lot of scrolling on smaller devices. To make usability easier, I made the sections above the content toggle (Why Choose Us and the calculator). The calculator also links through to the contact form, using the calculated result to populate the appropriate input field.</p>
				<p>The client also wanted a sticky/fixed header but with two navs, it really starts to reduce the userâ€™s view. I created a sticky header but made sure that when you start to scroll the height of the header reduces.</p>

				<h2 class="website__header">Sussex Ready Mixed Concrete</h2>
				<p>This was a relatively small site that I designed and built efficiently for a quick launch for the client. The challenge was incorporating their original logo into a fresh design. The dark grey and green are mixed with different tones to pull them together.</p>
				<p>The site features a concrete calculator that takes the result and inserts it into the contact form if the user chooses to click through to order online.</p>

				<p>The client wanted this site to fit in with their other website that they host with Adtrak. I kept the same colour scheme but the structure was changed to lend itself better to their new company. It displays their most popular features in the hero so that users can click straight through.</p>
				<p>Their logo was also amended to fit with the new company, incorporating a crane and buildings to link to their courses and training that they now provide.</p>

					<p>This is the final piece of my Fine Art degree. The project started with paintings that focused on movement and expression. These initial paintings were laid out on the floor so that I could find links between them. I made more paintings to fill in the gaps so that it resulted in a series of stills where the lines on each painting followed onto the next. The paintings were photographed and manipulated and turned into an animation using Photoshop and After Effects.</p>
