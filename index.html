				<p>The client wanted full access to the CMS, so its usability was very important. I built in extra functionality so that the client could decide the width of the hero image for each page with the toggle of a switch. All images, logos and text were pulled in from WordPress, so the client could add and change what they wanted. </p>
				<p>Features like this were important  to them because they were supplying content, and wanted to add a lot after coding had finished. Hidden fields in the their vacancy application form were also built in to automatically tell the client which job the user was applying for without the user having to specify themselves.</p>

				<p>I particularly enjoyed coding this site, I thought the design was very effective. I had to think carefully about the WordPress templates that I created and how I could efficiently create this site. The client was heavily involved and wanted full CMS access. This meant that anything I added in the backend of WordPress had to be as user friendly as possible to the inexperienced user.</p>

				<p>This design presented some interesting challenges for me to code. The images that run down either side of the pages had to be strategically placed to sit well on the page on different screen sizes. I also wanted the client to be able to change the images in the backend of WordPress if they wanted to, so the pattern had to be overlaid separately. This meant that the image will always be a full image that is resized appropriately and can be changed whenever the client wishes.</p>
				<p>There are a few design touches that I had to think about how to code them, including the offer the sits half on the hero and half below, and the patterns that sit either side of the page. The map is also a custom map to ensure the colours and layout matched the design.</p>

				<p>This was a single page site that was used to promote an event that Amtrak was sponsoring. I used a simple layout to convey as much information as possible about the event, whilst still being balanced and interesting to view.</p>
				<p>I was asked to incorporate Adtrak colours, as they were one of the main sponsors. Although it is quite a bright colour compared to the other sponsors, the result was nicely balanced.</p>
				<p>Please note: this is the demo site, as the actual site is no longer live.</p>

				<p>The content on this site is quite for down the page, which meant a lot of scrolling on smaller devices. To make usability easier, I made the sections above the content toggle (Why Choose Us and the calculator). The calculator also links through to the contact form, using the calculated result to populate the appropriate input field.</p>
				<p>The client also wanted a sticky/fixed header but with two navs, it really starts to reduce the user’s view. I created a sticky header but made sure that when you start to scroll the height of the header reduces.</p>

				<p>This was a relatively small site that I designed and built efficiently for a quick launch for the client. The challenge was incorporating their original logo into a fresh design. The dark grey and green are mixed with different tones to pull them together.</p>
				<p>The site features a concrete calculator that takes the result and inserts it into the contact form if the user chooses to click through to order online.</p>

					<p>This is the final piece of my Fine Art degree. The project started with paintings that focused on movement and expression. These initial paintings were laid out on the floor so that I could find links between them. I made more paintings to fill in the gaps so that it resulted in a series of stills where the lines on each painting followed onto the next. The paintings were photographed and manipulated and turned into an animation using Photoshop and After Effects.</p>
